"""
Business logic for pitch deck processing.

TODO: Implement functions to:
1. Extract information from PDF pitch decks
2. Use OpenAI API to analyze the deck
3. Generate investment assessment
4. Save results to database

You have complete creative freedom in your approach:
- Decide what information to extract
- Design your data structure
- Choose your extraction method (PyPDF2, vision models, etc.)
- Create your assessment criteria
- Structure your prompts

The core.utils module provides helper functions:
- sanitize_text(text): Clean extracted text
- log_task_execution: Decorator for logging (use on your task function)
