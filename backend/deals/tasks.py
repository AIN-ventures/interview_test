Celery tasks for asynchronous pitch deck processing.

TODO: Implement async processing task

Requirements:
- Use @shared_task decorator from Celery
- Accept deal_id as parameter
- Update Deal status appropriately (processing â†’ completed/failed)
- Call your service functions to extract and analyze
- Handle errors gracefully

Example structure:

from celery import shared_task
from core.utils import log_task_execution
from .models import Deal
from .services import your_functions_here

@shared_task
@log_task_execution
def process_deal_async(deal_id):
    try:
        # Your implementation here
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle errors
        pass
"""

# TODO: Import necessary modules and implement your task function
